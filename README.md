SonyAlpha
=========

This application is a remote controller for Sony Alpha series camera on FirefoxOS devices.
It is based on the camera application and offers a remote viewer and trigger.

Installation
------------

This is a privileged app so you need to load it manually.

````bash
git clone https://github.com/eliemichel/fxos-AlphaRemote.git
````

Or download the latest version in this [ZIP file](https://github.com/eliemichel/fxos-AlphaRemote/archive/master.zip).

Import the app into the [App Manager](https://developer.mozilla.org/Firefox_OS/Using_the_App_Manager). Then you can run it in the simulator, or in a Firefox OS device.
